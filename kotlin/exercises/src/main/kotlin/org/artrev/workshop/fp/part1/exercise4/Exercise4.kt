  -- Two argument Functions --

  Part 1:

  Take a look at the function declarations below:
*/

// this looks very nice
val oneArg: (Int) -> Int = { it }

// this looks almost as nice as the one above
val twoArg: (Int, Int) -> Int = { a, b -> a + b }

// this is getting worse
val threeArg: (Int, Int, Int) -> Int = { a, _, _ -> a }

// this is not workable
val nineArg: (Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int, Int) -> Int = { a, _, _, _, _, _, _, _, _ ->
    a
}

/*
  If you are moving to Kotlin from Java and your or your team is in a transition
  period, you could make this Kotlin notation more familiar for people with
  type aliases
 */

// Here type aliases that will be super familiar for folks using Java 8
typealias Function<A, B> = (A) -> B

typealias BiFunction<A, B, C> = (A, B) -> C
// etc...

/*
  The nine argument function like above can be shortened with a typealias, but
  depending on the types of arguments it might not help at all.

  Questions:
  - Does a two argument function or a three argument function (or nine argument
   function for that matter) even exists?
  - Do you see any problems with working with them?
  - Are there ways to make the code look more readable?

  Let's assume they do not exist and try to express them with only one argument
  function. We can wrap every argument into a single type.

  So Function2 is really a Function1 that has a >> pair << passed as an argument.
  In a pseudo code you could write it as:

  (A, B) -> C == (Pair<A, B>) -> C

  The same thing happens for Function3:

  (A, B, C) -> D == (Triple<A, B, C>) -> D

  We need special types like Pair or Triple. Some languages have support for
  tuples but in Kotlin we need to make them on our own (Kotlin dropped support
  for tuples in M3).

  In a JVM language called Ceylon each multi argument function is just a one
  argument function that takes a tuple as an argument. This makes supporting
  functions like Function2, Function3, ..., Function23 not necessary.
 */

/*
  Part 2:

  Create function called `tuple` that takes a (A, B) -> C as an argument and
  returns a (Pair<A, B>) -> C as a result
 */
fun <A, B, C> tuple(function: (A, B) -> C): (Pair<A, B>) -> C = { p -> function(p.first, p.second) }

/*
  Part 3:

  Create function called `unTuple` that takes a (Pair<A, B>) -> C that has a
  Pair as the argument and returns a (A, B) -> C as a result.
 */
fun <A, B, C> unTuple(function: (Pair<A, B>) -> C): (A, B) -> C = { a, b -> function(Pair(a,b))}

/*

      and `untuple` to fix the example code.

    val addPrefixUT: (String, String) -> String = { prefix, text ->
        prefix + text

        pint.first + pint.second

/*
  Let's try to define a two argument functions in terms of a one argument function
  again, this time without aiding ourselves with another class. Let's look at the
  two argument function declaration again:

  (A, B) -> C

  If we can only pass a single argument, let's say the A what do we have:

  (A) -> ???

  If we are going to pass only A, we are missing B to compute the C, this
  means that we are missing part of the computation, this means that we could
  split the computation. We could split it in as many parts as there are
  arguments.

  (A, B) -> C == (A) -> (B) -> C

  Our three argument function would look like:

  (A, B, C) -> D == (A) -> (B) -> (C) -> D

  This method of expressing functions is called currying.

  In a CLR language called F# all functions are curried by default.

// Example:
// Most verbose version
val strPlusInt1: (String) -> (Int) -> String = { string: String ->
    { int: Int ->
        "$string$int"
    }
}

// More concise
val strPlusInt2: (String) -> (Int) -> String = { string ->
    { int ->
        "$string$int"
    }
